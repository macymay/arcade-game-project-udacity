# Classic Arcade Game Project

Created as a project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program by yours truly, Macy McGahee.


## Information / Details

This is a very simple game that has one player. The player can move forward, backward, left or right but not off the game screen. There are bugs that are volatile for the player to run into. These enemy bugs loop around from left to right at varying speeds. The goal for the player is to reach the other end of the screen (where the water is) without colliding with any enemy bugs in the process. If the player makes it past the water successfully, 1 point will be added to the player's score. The player will be returned to the starting position and the amount of enemy bugs will increase making the difficulty higher after each score point that is earned.
